When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I would like to share my project online with my friends and let 
    them make some changes in it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because there might be some changes which I do not want to make it in my local
    repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub. Use this when you want to make 
    changes to a repository when you dont have access to the original repository.
    A clone is copy of a repository. This can be on the same machine, but it can also be a clone from a GitHub repository to your own machine. Use this for collaborating.
    Branches are leafs on the master branch. Those can be seen as a side track in which you can change code without changing the master branch. Use this for creating new features/bug fixes. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
